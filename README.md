### The struggles

I had to first create Assignment code, which was basically me listing out every variable in the arrays created for caps, alpha, numeric, and special characters. After the adding world variables, i went on to create the user prompts in "if" statements. when the user picked out the charcters it pushed the array into a "passwordOptions" where a charcterCheck would have a variable of a selected index at random push into that pool. then I added a generatePassword function with the help of MAX. I used two "for loops" that a charcterCheck would push a ranType that was selected in the passwordOptions pool, and into a var called pass, which is the final product of the the function , but not before i have the final password pushed in the text box with out "," between each varaible.
